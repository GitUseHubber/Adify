# Adifyy

A responsive, pure front-end website (landing page) built as my first web app using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

## Live Demo

You can open the site here:
- https://adifyy.netlify.app/ (a bit broken on Netlify)

## What’s Inside

- Responsive layout (works on desktop, tablet, and mobile)
- Modern landing-page sections (hero, pricing, features, testimonial, CTA, footer)
- Light front-end functionality with JavaScript (no backend)
- Super Fast

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Run Locally (Recommended)

1. Open the project folder in **VS Code**
2. Install the **Live Server** extension (from the VS Code Extensions tab)
3. In the Explorer, **left-click** `index.html`
4. **Right-click** `index.html` -> **Open with Live Server**

Your browser will open automatically and the site will run locally.

```

## Deployment

Deployed as a static site on Netlify:
- https://adifyy.netlify.app/

### About `/components`
This project uses a `components/` folder that contains **multiple HTML files** (sections / blocks) to keep the code organized and easier to manage while building the UI.

> Note: This is still a pure front-end project (no framework). The components are part of the project’s structure for cleaner development.
