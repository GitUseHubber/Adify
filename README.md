# Adifyy

A responsive, pure front-end website (landing page) built as my first web app using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

## Live Demo

You can open the site here:
- https://adifyy.netlify.app/

## What’s Inside

- Responsive layout (works on desktop, tablet, and mobile)
- Modern landing-page sections (hero, pricing, features, testimonial, CTA, footer)
- Light front-end functionality with JavaScript (no backend)

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Run Locally

1. Open the project folder in **VS Code**
2. Install the **Live Server** extension
   - Press `Ctrl + P`
   - Paste:
     ```
     ext install ritwickdey.liveserver
     ```
3. Open `index.html`, then start the server
   - Click **Go Live** in the VS Code status bar  
   **or**
   - Right-click `index.html` -> **Open with Live Server**

A browser tab will open automatically with your local site (usually something like `http://127.0.0.1:5500/`).

## Deployment

Deployed as a static site on Netlify:

### About `/components`
This project uses a `components/` folder that contains **multiple HTML files** (sections / blocks) to keep the code organized and easier to manage while building the UI.

> Note: This is still a pure front-end project (no framework). The components are part of the project’s structure for cleaner development.
