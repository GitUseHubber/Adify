# Adifyy

A responsive, pure front-end website (landing page) built as my first web app using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

## Live Demo

You can open the site here:
- https://adifyy.netlify.app/

## What’s Inside

- Responsive layout (works on desktop, tablet, and mobile)
- Modern landing-page sections (hero, pricing, features, testimonial, CTA, footer)
- Light front-end functionality with JavaScript (no backend)

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Run Locally

### Option 1 (Recommended): Live Server++ (smoothest)

Live Server++ is “truly live”, meaning it can refresh without you manually saving every time and feels smoother while building front-end projects.

1. Open this project folder in **VS Code**
2. Install **Live Server++**
   - Press `Ctrl + P`
   - Paste:
     ```
     ext install ritwickdey.vscode-live-server-plus-plus
     ```
3. Start the server
   - Click **Go Live++** in the VS Code status bar  
   **or**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and run:
     - `Live Server++: Open Server`

Your browser will open automatically. If not, open the local address shown by the extension (usually `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`).

### Option 2: Live Server (classic)

1. Install **Live Server**
   - Press `Ctrl + P`
   - Paste:
     ```
     ext install ritwickdey.liveserver
     ```
2. Start it
   - Open `index.html`
   - Click **Go Live** in the status bar  
   **or**
   - Right-click `index.html` in the explorer -> **Open with Live Server**

## Deployment

Deployed as a static site on Netlify:
- https://adifyy.netlify.app/

### About `/components`
This project uses a `components/` folder that contains **multiple HTML files** (sections / blocks) to keep the code organized and easier to manage while building the UI.

> Note: This is still a pure front-end project (no framework). The components are part of the project’s structure for cleaner development.
